 Faker Jedidi Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This project showcases my work as a Data Scientist and Software Developer, featuring a collection of impactful projects in data science, machine learning, software development, and data engineering. The portfolio is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, hosted on GitHub Pages, and highlights my ability to deliver intelligent, real-world solutions.

Portfolio Overview

This portfolio includes a variety of projects developed during my academic and professional journey, demonstrating skills in data analysis, machine learning, web development, and telecom systems. Below is a summary of the featured projects:

F1 Race Winner Prediction Project
- Description: An individual project to predict 2025 Formula 1 race winners using historical race data and machine learning. The system leverages the FastF1 library for race data (e.g., lap times, sector times) and the OpenWeatherMap API for weather conditions, predicting average lap times with a Gradient Boosting Regressor (MAE ~0.07 seconds).
-*Key Features:
  - Data pipeline processes 2024 F1 race data, handling missing values and integrating weather data.
  - Interactive interface for selecting races (e.g., Bahrain, Monaco) and viewing predicted podiums with full driver names.
  - Visualizations include scatter plots of clean air race pace vs. predicted lap times and feature importance charts.
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, FastF1, Requests.

 Diabetes Prediction Project
- Description: A Python-based system to predict diabetes outcomes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, employing a Decision Tree Classifier (accuracy ~0.6924) and interactive visualizations.
- Key Features:
  - Data pipeline handles missing values and outliers in features like Glucose, BloodPressure, and BMI.
  - Visualizations include scatter plots and histograms for feature analysis.
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Colab.

 Tunisian House Prices Prediction
- Description**: A predictive model to estimate house prices in Tunisia using a Kaggle dataset, focusing on exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
- Key Features:
  - EDA with outlier removal and feature creation (e.g., `Area_Cat`, `Plus_features`).
  - Visualizations include scatter plots, histograms, and a Tunisia map plot.
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Kaggle.

 Mobile Clock Application for Aurax
- Description: A mobile app developed for Aurax to manage employee attendance, built during a 2023 internship at Institut Supérieur des Études Technologiques de Kélibia.
- Key Features:
  - Features license activation, PIN authentication, and pointage options (Arrivée, Pause, Retour de pause, Départ).
  - Admin dashboards for pointage correction and absence management.
- Technologies: Android Studio, React Native, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, Visual Paradigm.

 Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Points Prediction Project
- Description: A predictive model to forecast FPL player points, assisting managers in team selection with an 85% accuracy using Random Forest Regressor (RMSE ~2.75).
- Key Features:
  - Processes player statistics and fixture data via the FPL API.
  - Interactive visualizations and a Flask web interface for real-time predictions.
- Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask, API Integration.

 Automated QoS Data Processing System
- Description: A system developed during a 2025 internship at BI4T to automate Quality of Service (QoS) data processing for 2G/3G/4G/5G networks, reducing manual effort by 90%.
- Key Features:
  - Java/Spring Batch pipeline for multi-format data processing.
  - PostgreSQL/PostGIS database for geospatial KPI analysis.
  - Real-time dashboards and coverage maps for network monitoring.
- Technologies: Java, Spring Batch, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Bash, Cron.
